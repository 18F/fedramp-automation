If so, please list them.
- [ ]  11a If this is a SaaS or a PaaS, is it "leveraging" another IaaS with a FedRAMP Authorization?
- [ ]  11b If 11a is Yes, are the "inherited" controls clearly identified in the control descriptions?
- [ ]  12  Are all interconnections correctly identified and documented in the SSP?
- [ ]  13  Are all required controls present?
- [ ]  14  Is the inventory provided in the FedRAMP Integrated Inventory Workbook?
